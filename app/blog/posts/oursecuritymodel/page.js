        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm">Enhancing Backend Security with Xano: A Comprehensive Overview</p>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm">In today's digital landscape, backend security is paramount for businesses looking to protect sensitive data and maintain user trust. Xano, a powerful no-code backend solution, prioritizes security, offering a robust suite of features designed to safeguard your applications.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">1. Encryption at Rest</h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm">One of the cornerstone features of Xano’s security model is encryption at rest. This means that data stored in Xano’s databases is automatically encrypted, ensuring that even if unauthorized access occurs, the information remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption keys.</p>
        <p className="font-bold">Benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-base sm:text-sm">
          <li><strong>Data Protection:</strong> Sensitive information such as user credentials, personal data, and financial details are shielded from potential breaches.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Encryption at rest helps meet regulatory requirements such as GDPR and HIPAA, providing peace of mind for businesses operating in regulated industries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">2. SSL/TLS Encryption</h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm">Xano provides SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption for all data transmitted between clients and servers. This ensures that data in transit is encrypted, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
        <p className="font-bold">Benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-base sm:text-sm">
          <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> SSL protects the integrity and confidentiality of data as it moves across the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>User Trust:</strong> Websites and applications using SSL are marked as secure, fostering trust among users who see the padlock icon in their browsers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-sm">Xano incorporates role-based access control, allowing developers to set granular permissions for different users and roles within the application. This feature ensures that only authorized personnel can access or manipulate sensitive data.</p>
        <p className="font-bold">Benefits:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 text-base sm:text-sm">
          <li><strong>Minimized Risk:</strong> Limiting access to data and functionality reduces the potential for accidental or malicious misuse.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> With clear access logs, organizations can monitor who accessed what data and when, enhancing accountability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">4. API Security</h2>

          <li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> API keys can be regenerated, and permissions can be adjusted, providing flexibility and control over who interacts with your backend.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring and Reporting:</strong> Xano provides tools to monitor API usage, enabling quick responses to any suspicious activities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-xl font-bold mt-6 bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">5. Regular Security Updates</h2>
